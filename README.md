# Tinker_FROMP_RL
FROMP in reinforcement learning

Use regularized.py in Google Colab, with images.py and get_memorable.py in the files. 
regularized.py will train a deep q network on games from MinAtar (miniature Atari) and save models to MyDrive/aim_mini/regularized_models.
It will automatically delete older versions of the saved model; empty your Drive's trashcan frequently.
After the deep q network is trained with and without regularization, use test_model.py to compare them.
